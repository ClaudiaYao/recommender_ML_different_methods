They are as follows:\n","\n","1. **Simple Recommender:** This system used overall TMDB Vote Count and Vote Averages to build Top Movies Charts, in general and for a specific genre. The IMDB Weighted Rating System was used to calculate ratings on which the sorting was finally performed.\n","2. **Content Based Recommender:** We built two content based engines; one that took movie overview and taglines as input and the other which took metadata such as cast, crew, genre and keywords to come up with predictions. We also deviced a simple filter to give greater preference to movies with more votes and higher ratings.\n","3. **Collaborative Filtering:** We used the powerful Surprise Library to build a collaborative filter based on single value decomposition. The RMSE obtained was less than 1 and the engine gave estimated ratings for a given user and movie.\n","4. **Hybrid Engine:** We brought together ideas from content and collaborative filterting to build an engine that gave movie suggestions to a particular user based on the estimated ratings that it had internally calculated for that user.\n","\n","Previous -> [The Story of Film](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-story-of-film/)"],"metadata":{"_uuid":"ad1edcae8eecd5c725edbe18082bc4d8103ca800","_cell_guid":"812fc4c7-b334-4f54-a05f-8fc0e7962a92","id":"0wWMcmddIZmi"},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"execution_count":null,"source":[],"metadata":{"_uuid":"e53889f19f6d352bb0418567941dff8f9e57da41","_cell_guid":"304b0809-4070-4954-99ed-203a4b8b6956","collapsed":true,"id":"_6TlhRVrIZmi"},"cell_type":"code"}],"nbformat_minor":0,"nbformat":4,"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","mimetype":"text/x-python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.3"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-colab-exported-notebooks/movie-recommender-systems-0ea3f443-b460-4eaf-ab55-9cf9c5002f93.ipynb?X-Goog-Algorithm=GOOG4-RSA-SHA256&X-Goog-Credential=gcp-kaggle-com%40kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com/20240712/auto/storage/goog4_request&X-Goog-Date=20240712T084856Z&X-Goog-Expires=259200&X-Goog-SignedHeaders=host&X-Goog-Signature=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","timestamp":1720774147025}]}}}
